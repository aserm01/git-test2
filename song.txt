I’ve got a fever, don't breathe on me.
I’m a believer of nobody.
Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something.
Hope I don't sneeze, I don't... ahchoo!

Really we just need to fear something,
Only pretending to feel something.
I know you're dying to run.
I want to turn you around.

Рlease, remain calm,
The end has arrived.
We cannot save you,
Enjoy the ride.
This is the moment
You’ve been waiting for.
Don’t call it a warning,
This is a war.
