I’ve got a fever, don't breathe on me.
I’m a believer of nobody.
Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something.
Hope I don't sneeze, I don't... ahchoo!

Really we just need to fear something,
Only pretending to feel something.
I know you're dying to run.
I want to turn you around.

Рlease, remain calm,
The end has arrived.
We cannot save you,
Enjoy the ride.
This is the moment
You’ve been waiting for.
Don’t call it a warning,
This is a war.

It’s the Parasite Eve.
Got a feeling in your stomach,
‘cause you know that it’s coming for you.
Leave your flowers and grieve,
Don’t forget what they told you.
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn’t kill you,
Something else will.

Move
